When bringing together the different pages in our software project, we heavily relied on thorough unit testing to make sure everything seamlessly integrated. Our approach was to carefully test each individual page to ensure its functionality worked independently before merging. This helped us catch and fix issues at the unit level, avoiding potential problems during the consolidation phase. Through rigorous unit testing, we not only tackled issues early in development but also made the integration process smoother, resulting in a more stable and reliable software application.
